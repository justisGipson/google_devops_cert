## Getting Started

Welcome to Developing a Google SRE Culture! By enrolling in this course, you’ll be joining a huge, international community of business and IT leaders who are helping their organizations work towards adoption of Site Reliability Engineering technical and cultural practices.

What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?

Site Reliability Engineering, or SRE, is both a practice and a job role, where engineering directly supports software operations. At Google, SRE is described by its founder as "what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team."

What to expect during this training course?

During this training course, you will be presented with a series of modules that will take you through the journey to SRE. You will learn about how both DevOps and SRE emerged in software engineering, and get an overview of important technical and cultural practices that are critical to an organization’s success in adopting SRE. The modules in this course may have videos, exercises, and quizzes.

In order to pass the quizzes, remembering details from the videos and exercises is advised.

In order to get the best training experience, please ensure that you are prepared:

- Ensure that you have headphones or your speakers are on, if you're in an enclosed space.
- Watch videos in their entirety and review the recommended module exercises.

### Course Intro

Hi, I'm Kiran Varma, a curriculum developer at Google Cloud. Welcome to Developing a Google SRE Culture. I've teamed up with experts from Google Cloud, SRE and Professional Services teams to create this course for IT and business leaders who want to learn about and embrace SRE culture in their organizations. Have you ever had a concern about the reliability of your services? Have you ever seen a decline in customer engagement, but when you question your team, they can't explain why it's happening? Both your development and operations teams say, "Everything's green." But you know, there must be something wrong because your end users, your customers, are telling you so. If you've spent any significant amount of time producing and running production software, you've probably also felt the frustration of negatively impacting customers when deploying minor updates. You've probably also questioned whether the production freeze your ops team ordered is really based on fact, because you're desperate to push your next release for the important features. If these situations seem familiar to you, you're probably wondering why your development and operations teams often have conflicting priorities, and why they continue to work in silos. Google has spent years running systems in massive scale. Over time, we've standardize our practices to balance our velocity of features with the risk to reliability, both for us and for our customers. Those practices, combined with a culture to support them, we call Site Reliability Engineering or SRE. Whether you're still deciding how and when to make the move to the Cloud, or you're already an adopter of Cloud technology, this course can help you understand how practical and cultural SRE principals could have a lasting positive impact on both your IT transformation projects and day-to-day work. You'll also learn how an organization size and maturity level for SRE can affect the implementation of these principles. This course will give you an overview of SRE technical and cultural fundamentals, and will explain where and how you can apply them in your organization. Because SRE principles are closely aligned with DevOps philosophy practices, the course will also cover the basics of DevOps. Even if you're already familiar with DevOps practices, you'll hear how Google interprets the philosophy, so hopefully you'll learn something new. This course has several overall learning objectives. By the end of this course, you'll be able to discuss Google's view on DevOps philosophy, and the relationship between DevOps and SRE; understand the value SRE can provide to your IT operations; articulate Google's technical and cultural fundamentals of SRE; assess your organization's maturity level in adopting SRE; identify what skills to look for in a Site Reliability Engineer, and how to train your existing workforce; and finally, understand how Google can help you jumpstart SRE in your organization. Now let's review the course components in structure. This course has seven modules. The first six consists of video lessons, activities, and quizzes. In the seventh module, you'll need to pass a graded assessment to show what you've learned. The first module is the course introduction and structure, which I'm covering right now. In the second module, DevOps, SRE, and why they exist, you'll be introduced to DevOps philosophy and how SRE practices emerged. Modules 3-5 will cover the journey to SRE. In module 3, SLOs with Consequences. You'll learn about the SRE concepts of service level objectives, error budgets, blamelessness, and psychological safety. Module 4, Make Tomorrow Better Than Today, will cover the concepts of toil monitoring, implementing gradual change, and the impact automation has on IT teams. The fifth module, Regulate Workload, covers topics around measurement and SRE practices related to measuring toil and reliability. Once you've learned about the key SRE technical and cultural fundamentals, the sixth module, Apply SRE in Your Organization will discuss steps to begin SRE implementation in your organization. Finally, the last module contains a summative graded assessment to evaluate the knowledge you've acquired throughout the course. I hope you're excited to dive in. Now, let's get started.
